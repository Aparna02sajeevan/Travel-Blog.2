<h2>What first time visitors to Delhi need to know</h2>
     <p>Delhi is a summary of all that India is from its super modern metro to its crumbling havelis (historic stately homes) 
        </p><p>from its dusty spice markets to its gleaming and luxurious shopping malls.</p>
<p>
    </p><p>But if there’s one reason that stands out most to us as a reason to visit, it’s Delhi’s history..</p>
    <p>Delhi is one of the longest-serving capitals in the world, and has witnessed the rise and fall of empires</p>
    <p>A walk through Delhi can take you past monuments from the late 1100s to the present day, in a city heavily influenced by the Mughals, the British and many others</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> Delhi is still not the easiest place in India for female travellers. Dressing conservatively is advised, and I do not recommend solo women to go out alone at night in Delhi</p>
    <p> Delhi is suffering yet another bout of toxic smog, as pleas to stop Diwali firecrackers fall on deaf ears, 
        </p><p>farmers in nearby regions burn their crops, and the government does little to work on the issue of environmental pollution.</p>

        <p>Over the last few years, this has happened every year immediately after Diwali. The air in Delhi</p>
    <h4>Here are some of our tried and tested Delhi travel tips for newcomers.</h4>
    
        <li>If you’re staying in a mid-range or upscale hotel (which is a good idea), arrange an airport pickup directly with them for a smooth landing </li>
        <li>If you’re flying long-haul, build in some time to rest and take it easy – Delhi can be overwhelming, especially when you’re tired.</li>
        <li>Organise a tour for your first day in Delhi – Helps you to get your bearings and ease in to the pace of Delhi with the comfort of someone showing you around.</li>
        <li>Ignore offers of “free” tuk-tuk rides or shopping tours. Anything that is “free” will invariably lead to you being taken to a number of shops,<p>Over the last few years, this has happened every year immediately after Diwali. The air in Delhi</p></li>
        <li>Generally ignore people who come up to you at railway stations asking to see your ticket or at monuments – they are usually touts although their sales pitch may not come immediately.</li>
        <li>Just after Diwali is not the ideal time to visit Delhi. Every year, the city gets covered in toxic smog. It’s better to visit later in the winter if you can.</li>
        <li>The key with Delhi is to be cautious but not paranoid – hold your head up high, walk like you know where you’re going, and you’ll likely find people leave you alone!</li>

<h2>Best Route fot Traveling</h2>
  
    <li>One of the best options for a safe transfer from the airport is to have your hotel arrange a transfer.
<p> Make sure they’ll be inside the terminal with a sign with the hotel’s name, or with a “password”</p>
<p> and check their identity carefully before leaving with your driver or ask them for your names to be sure they’re the real deal and not just a random person with a sign.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Sakha Cabs, powered by Women on Wheels offer transfers and taxi services for women travellers, by women drivers. <p></p>
        <p>The Azad Foundation behind the Women on Wheels initiative started it in Delhi in 2008 to bring economic empowerment to women by enabling them to become professional drivers.</p></li>
            <p> Do your bit to support them by arranging an airport transfer with them!</p>
    <li> Meru cabs from New Delhi Airport while travelling alone in Delhi – there’s a separate desk for them when exiting arrivals. They’re a little more expensive than regular cabs but I have found them to be reliable and safe.

    </li>


<h2>Where to stay</h2>

    <li><strong>Paharganj</strong></li>
    <p>Paharganj is ground zero for Delhi’s tourist scams and hustle,</p>
    <p> and is home to possibly the grottiest of accommodation. Proceed with caution and check reviews carefully.</p>

    <p></p>
    <li><strong>Karol Bagh</strong></li>
    <p>The hotels here are cheap but they attract a very mixed crowd, and during my stay I did not feel particularly relaxed (or very safe) in this part of town. </p>
    <p>I would not recommend walking around alone at night. There have also been issues with hotel fires in Karol Bagh. Stay elsewhere if you can.</p>

    <p></p>
    <li><strong>Prakash Kutir</strong></li>
    <p>Prakash Kutir is located just off Hauz Khas market which is perfect for getting to grips with Delhi local life, enjoying a good espresso,</p>
    <p> and is handily connected to the city by Metro – there’s currently a new line under construction to the airport too.I loved the experi ence of sta</p>
    <p>ying with an Indian family in their home, waking up to the musical calls of the local vegetable wallahs outside, and getting to know the family better over breakfast each morning. </p>
    <p>It’s also a very safe part of the city. The Gupta family offer a truly comfortable and charming home from home in Delhi. </p>
